An OpenGL application which generates a terrain geometry and renders the 3D
scene on the GPU. A camera, pictorially illustrated in the global view, follows
a configurable Bézier path through the scene. It was realized as a semester
project for an introductory lesson in computer graphics at EPFL.

Featured techniques:

* Procedural terrain generated by hybrid multi-fractal with Perlin noise
  function.
* Material texturing based on terrain height and gradient.
* Seamless cube-mapped skybox.
* Self-shadowing using shadow mapping.
* Water reflection, refraction and depth effects.
* Free flying and FPS exploration modes.
* Runtime configurable Bézier camera path: 2 Béziers, 8 control points.
* Animated pictorial camera along the path.
* Particles system: 8000 particles which position and speed are controlled in
  parallel by the GPU.
* Two (interchangeable) simultaneous views: global and camera.
* Object oriented programing.
